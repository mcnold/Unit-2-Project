            <h4>
                Both Astrology and Tarot are based on the principles of the four elements: air, water, fire and earth. Just as the Zodiac signs are based on these four elements, so are the suits in a Tarot deck of cards. 

The Face Cards in the Tarot are related to the four elements: The King represents Fire; the Queen represents Water; the Knight represents Air and the Page represents Earth.
