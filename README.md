User Stories
As a tarot student, I want to visually see each card. I want to be able to update my study list (ex. add a card to study, delete a card to study). I want to be able to read a description of each card. I want to be able to add a description entry box for the study page for practice to demonstrate knowledge learned. I want to be able to understand the difference of the majors, the minors, the ranks, and the Tarot Journey/number position. I want to be able to clearly navigate the site.
